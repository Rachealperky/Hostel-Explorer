To create a database for a hostel booking application involving students, hostel managers, and university administration, we would typically need several tables to manage the data efficiently. Here's a plan for the database tables:

Users Table:

This table will store common user information for students, hostel managers, and university administration.
Fields may include user ID, username, password (hashed), email, first name, last name, phone number, and role (e.g., student, hostel manager, admin).
You can use a user ID as the primary key.

Students Table:

This table stores additional student-specific information.
Fields may include student ID, university ID (foreign key), student's academic details, emergency contact information, etc.
Use the student ID as the primary key.
Establish a foreign key relationship with the Users table using the user ID.

Hostels Table:

This table holds information about the hostels available.
Fields may include hostel ID, hostel name, location, capacity, available beds, and other details.

Bookings Table:

This table manages bookings made by students.
Fields may include booking ID, student ID (foreign key), hostel ID (foreign key), booking date, check-in date, check-out date, and booking status.

Payments Table:

This table stores payment details for bookings.
Fields may include payment ID, booking ID (foreign key), payment date, amount, payment method, and payment status.

Requests Table:

Students can submit requests or complaints.
Fields may include request ID, student ID (foreign key), request type, request details, status (pending, resolved), and timestamp.

Hostel Managers Table:

This table stores information about hostel managers.
Fields may include manager ID, hostel ID (foreign key), contact details, and user ID (foreign key).

University Administration Table:

Information about university administration can be stored in this table.
Fields may include admin ID, university position, contact information, and user ID (foreign key).

Messages Table:

To facilitate communication, a messages table can be created.
Fields may include message ID, sender (user ID), receiver (user ID), timestamp, message content, and status (read/unread).

Notifications Table:

This table stores notifications sent to users, such as booking confirmations, request updates, and payment receipts.
Fields may include notification ID, user ID (foreign key), notification type, notification content, timestamp, and status.

Audit Log Table:

To keep track of important database events and user activities, create an audit log table.
Fields may include log ID, user ID (foreign key), activity type (e.g., login, booking creation, payment), timestamp, and IP address.

Roles and Permissions Table:

To manage access control, create a table that associates roles with permissions.
Fields may include role ID, role name (e.g., student, hostel manager, admin), and associated permissions (e.g., read bookings, create bookings, manage hostels).

By structuring oyr database with these tables, we can efficiently manage user data, bookings, payments, requests, and communication within our hostel booking application. Making sure to establish relationships (foreign keys) between related tables to maintain data integrity and consistency. Additionally, we shall implement appropriate indexing and security measures to ensure the performance and protection of our database.
